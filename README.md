## Description
In this course we convert the client side web application, made during the Web App From Scratch course, into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Finally we’ll implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.

## Goals
After finishing this program you can:
- _deal with server side rendering;_
- _implement a Service Worker;_
- _enhance the critical render path for a better runtime or percieved performance._

## Grading
Your efforts will be graded using a single point rubric (see below). You will have to pass the criterion (centre column) to pass the course. During the test you will be consulted and will be given feedback on things we think deficient and things we think are an improvement on the criterion.

| Deficiency | Criterion | Improvement |
|:--|:--|:--|
|  | *Project* Your app is published and can be accessed using the browser. Your project is thoroughly documented in the `README.md` file in your repository. Included are an explanation of client- server rendering, an activity diagram including the Service Worker and a list of enhancements to optimize the critical render path implemented your app. |  |
|  |*Serverside rendering* You’ve implemented serverside rendering and have articulated how it works and why you should want it. |  |
|  |*Service Worker* You’ve implemented a usefull Service Worker and show it’s working in an activity diagram. |  |
|  |*Critical render path* You’ve enhanced the critical render path for a better runtime or percieved performance in multiple ways and have described how you managed to do this. |  |

### Week 1 - Server Side Rendering 📡
Goal: Render web pages server side

[Exercises for week 1](./course/week-1.md)

#### Monday 20 maart    
We start out with a short explanation of this course. Right behind is a presentation on Server Side Rendering by Declan Rek from *de Voorhoede* [Server Side Rendering - slides by Declan Rek](course/cmd-2022-server-side-rendering.pdf)

After this presentation you may start working on [this weeks exercises](./course/week-1.md). We’ll hold standup meetings in teams according to the roster you see at [daily schedule](#daily-schedule). At the end of the day you’ll do a wrap-up of your work and take the evening off.

#### Tuesday 21 maart
We’ll split up in two groups, those who want to go through the details again team up with Justus, those who want to go deeper team up with Declan. Both groups will hold live-coding sessions and will be able to ask questions.

After this live-coding session you continue working on [this weeks exercises](./course/week-1.md). We’ll hold standup meetings in teams according to the roster you see at [daily schedule](#daily-schedule). You’ll finish with a wrap-up of your work and take the evening off.

#### Friday 24 maart
We’ll be introduced to ****! They’ll show us around their workfloor and tell us about (working in) their company. You can use the spare time to finish [this weeks exercises](./course/week-1.md) and ask questions. Wrap-up your work and take off for the weekend. We might go for drinks..

| Time | Who | Activity |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 13.00 | Tribe *+(Declan, Janno)* | Questions.. |
| 13.30 | Tribe *+(Declan, Janno)* | Meeting with company? |
| 16.00 | Tribe *+(Declan?, Janno?)* | (drinks?!) |

<!-- Here are some hints for your project! -->

<!-- Start out with a title and a description -->

<!-- Add a nice image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend 📸 -->

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages 🌐-->

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages 🌍 -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? 📚 -->

<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- ...you should implement an explanation of client- server rendering choices 🍽 -->

<!-- ...and an activity diagram including the Service Worker 📈 -->

<!-- This would be a good place for a list of enhancements to optimize the critical render path implemented your app  -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- We all stand on the shoulders of giants, please link all the sources you used in to create this project. -->

<!-- How about a license here? When in doubt use GNU GPL v3. 📜  -->
